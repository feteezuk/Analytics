Categorizing into users and sessions
When the tracking code sends over hits, Google Analytics adds other user information it can detect and then processes that data into reports. It's important to know how data gets processed in order to make informed decisions about your data collection.

Categorizing data into users and sessions
Let’s look at the first few steps in which Google Analytics processes data.
* First, Analytics determines new vs. returning users.
* Then it categorizes hits into session (or periods in which the user engaged with the site).
* Next, it joins data from the tracking code with other data sources.
